# Biodiversity Databases

Process and tools to wrangle with biodiversity data, especially GBIF, BC CDC, BC SPI

GBIF Backbone used as taxonomic reference or key.

Notes:
- Only species level records used. 
- Population level classifications ar difficult to work with. For Bowen, I think the only species present where separate populations are identified is Orca. 
- The cleanest approach is to only include records that are tracked by the BC Conservation Centre. This helps with sorting and for consistency, but also helps to cull records that do not belong in BC. However, this will mean that some species will drop off that a real but are not tracked by the CDC.
